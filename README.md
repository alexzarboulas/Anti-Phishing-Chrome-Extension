# Anti-Phishing-Chrome-Extension
An innovative anti-phishing Chrome extension that uses user history, a whitelist, and HTML scanning to detect malicious websites.

A security warning will be sent to the user if and only if:
-The website they are visiting is not whitelisted AND
-They have never visited the website before AND
-They website has input fields AND
-They user types something

The extension is continually being updated. Research is going into identifying the most efficient (with the least false positives) "warning" algorithm. The whitelist is being expanded to more trusted websites.
